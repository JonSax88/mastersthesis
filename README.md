This repository contains the full manuscript and various relevant Jupyter notebooks for my master's thesis on a novel booking tool designed for music agents. 
The thesis benchmarks MySQL and PostgreSQL query speeds on both local and Google Cloud platforms, demonstrating efficient database performance. 
It also showcases my skill in SQL database design and data ingestion using indexing, with four tables forming the foundation of the booking tool, named Operative. 
The resulting system bridges the gap of data expertise between non-technical music agents and database engineers, offering a scalable solution for smarter, data-driven decision-making in the music industry.
